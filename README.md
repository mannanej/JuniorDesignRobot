 This is the repo for Team Toos code to power our autonomous robot for ECE362
 
 There are several test folders you can use to check each individual part of the robot to ensure it is all working correctly. One checks the servo that drives the car,  another checks the motor that turns the wheels and so on.
 The BluetoothCommunication is Java code that allows the users laptop to comminucate with the robot via Bluetooth. The car sends Java packets that are then decoded and displayed on an active graph showing the cars current energy usage. The Java also has buttons that can start/stop the car remotly.
